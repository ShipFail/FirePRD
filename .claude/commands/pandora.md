You always follow principles from below books:

1. The Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing, Thinking, & Problem Solving Expanded Edition, by Barbara Minto
    - Think and communicate top-down ‚Äî start with the answer, then explain it logically.
    - Start with the answer; group ideas MECE; order by logic, time, or importance; summarize before detail; ask Why/So-what; one idea per paragraph; define the question; build the pyramid; reason inductively or deductively; respect reader flow; separate logic from story; and make headlines tell the point.

You always follow best practices from below methodologies:

1. Google Design Sprint, by Kake Knapp
    - combines
	    - Design Thinking (empathy, ideation, prototyping)
	    - Lean Startup (build‚Äìmeasure‚Äìlearn)
	    - Agile (fast iteration)
    - Map the problem on Monday, sketch solutions on Tuesday, decide and storyboard on Wednesday, prototype fast on Thursday, and test with real users on Friday ‚Äî to learn, align, and de-risk big ideas in just five focused days.

## UltimateDocument

The UltimateDocument is a PRD document that can cover all the product features in the current software application. 

The UltimateDocument should include all product experience / features / etc from the user experience perspect.

The UltimateDocument will not include:

1. not include any implementation details
1. not include any Data Architecture & State Management
1. not include any AI Integration & Generation Flows
1. not include any Error Handling & Edge Cases

This UltimateDocument will be the perfect product document to send to SWE for implementing the whole system, without lacking any product information.

The UltimateDocument should follow the Minto Pyramid Principle and the Google Design Sprint form two complementary dimensions of structured thinking:
    - Minto Pyramid Principle governs how you think and communicate (logic),
    - Google Design Sprint governs how you explore and decide (process).

## Your Job

Your objective is: build outline of the UltimateDocument of current project, as detail as possible.

Steps:
1. Read all source code files from the current project, understand the big picture of the product as well as all the features and the user journeys; also analyze the technical architecture and implementation details. do not read any documents file because they might outdated and misleading. ignore functions/ folder because it is firebase functions, it's backend only source code and has no affect to the product user experience / features.
1. only think by following Minto Pyramid principles, design a 3-level outlines for the UltimateDocument
1. only think by following Google Design Sprint best practices, design a 3-level outlines for the UltimateDocument
1. merge two list from previous two steps, merge them all, then re-design a new 3-level outlines for the UltimateDocument
1. for each item in the outline, order them with the level number, like 1-2-3, then explain why they are one of the most important and indispensable part of the document.
1. based on the understanding of the application, generate outlines with the level-ed order number with the explaination, to docs/prd-outline.md.

Always ask questions if you think something is missing, or not sure about something, do not hesitate to ask.
