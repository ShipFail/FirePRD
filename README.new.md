# üî• FirePRD: Turn Your Code into a PRD, Instantly.

**FirePRD is an agent-driven framework that analyzes your codebase and collaborates with you to generate a human-centered Product Requirements Document (PRD).**

## The Problem: Documentation is Painful

Your codebase is the ultimate source of truth, but it's unreadable to non-technical stakeholders like Product Managers, designers, and executives. Writing and maintaining a PRD that accurately reflects your application is a tedious, manual process that often gets neglected, leading to stale documents and misaligned teams.

## The Solution: An AI Product Team in Your IDE

FirePRD acts like a dedicated product team that lives in your IDE. It automates the most painful parts of the documentation process:

1.  **A Code Analyst** reads your code to understand its features and structure.
2.  **A Product Writer** collaborates with you to design the document and tell the product's story.
3.  **An Orchestrator** manages the entire stateful, resumable workflow, ensuring you are always in control.

The result is a comprehensive, non-technical PRD, generated with a fraction of the manual effort.

## Why FirePRD? (Value Propositions)

* **‚ö°Ô∏è Speed up Onboarding:** Generate a clear, readable PRD to help new engineers and stakeholders understand your project in minutes, not weeks.
* **‚úÖ Ensure Accuracy:** The PRD is generated directly from the source code, eliminating the risk of human error and outdated information.
* **ü§ù Improve Alignment:** Create a shared "source of truth" that both technical and non-technical team members can understand and rally behind.
* **üßò Stay in the Flow:** The entire process happens inside your IDE. No context switching, no cumbersome documentation tools. You stay focused on your code.

## How It Works: The 5-Step Mental Model

FirePRD guides you through a simple, command-driven workflow. You are always in control.

1.  `*start`: You point FirePRD at your codebase to initialize a new session.
2.  `*analyze`: The agent autonomously analyzes the code and creates a technical summary.
3.  `*design-toc`: You and the agent collaborate to design the structure (Table of Contents) of your PRD.
4.  `*finalize-plan`: You give the final approval on the complete plan.
5.  `*generate-all-chapters`: The agent writes the final PRD files to your project directory.
